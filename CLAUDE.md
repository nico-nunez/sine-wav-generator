# Project Context

## About This Project
- **Audio software development learning project** - Experienced TypeScript developer learning C++ and DSP for production-quality audio software/plugin development
- Goal is to build production-ready synthesizer while learning C++ and DSP concepts
- Learning through doing, not toy examples

## Technical Approach
- **Favor industry-standard patterns over "simple" solutions** - the goal is production quality, not educational shortcuts
- **Assume solid programming background** - focus C++ and DSP-specific knowledge, not basic programming concepts
- **Explain the "why"** - understanding rationale behind audio/DSP design patterns is key
- **Real-world considerations matter** - performance, thread safety, and audio-specific concerns should be considered

## Working Style
- **DO NOT update files unless explicitly requested** - this is a learning project and automatic fixes defeat the purpose
- Offer suggestions, explanations, and guidance instead of making changes
- When presenting options, explain trade-offs but lean toward industry best practices
- Exception: Documentation and reference materials can be created/updated when asked

## Documentation Style
Reference docs in `_docs_/` (note the underscores) should be:
- **Concise and to the point** - no excessive filler
- **Scannable** - clear sections, code examples, key takeaways
- **Practical** - focus on "aha moments" and common gotchas
- If it's too long or wordy, it won't get read!

### Documentation Requirements
1. **Table of Contents** - All doc files must include a table of contents with section links at the top
2. **README.md Updates** - When creating new docs, add them to the corresponding README.md file in the directory
3. **Keep Index Current** - Ensure all existing docs are listed in their directory's README.md
