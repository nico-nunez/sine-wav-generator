# C++ Reference Guide

A growing collection of C++ concepts and patterns, organized by topic.

## Quick Reference
- **[Core Concepts](core-concepts.md)** - Namespaces, includes, function parameters, ownership

## Object-Oriented Programming
- **[Classes](classes.md)** - Class basics, access specifiers, constructors, methods
- **[Polymorphism](polymorphism.md)** - Virtual functions, abstract classes, inheritance, vtables
- **[Structs and Constructors](structs-and-constructors.md)** - Struct basics and initialization

## Functions and Callbacks
- **[Function Pointers](function-pointers.md)** - Function pointer syntax, callbacks, strategy pattern
- **[Lambdas](lambdas.md)** - Lambda syntax, captures, std::function, closures
- **[Pointers and References](pointers-and-references.md)** - Pointer basics, `new`/`delete`, `->` vs `.`, stack vs heap

## Memory and Data
- **[Memory Management](memory-management.md)** - Stack vs heap, ownership, move semantics, RAII
- **[Smart Pointers](smart-pointers.md)** - unique_ptr, shared_ptr, ownership semantics, performance
- **[Arrays and Containers](arrays-and-containers.md)** - Raw arrays vs std::vector, buffer overflows, safety
- **[Integer Types](integer-types.md)** - Integer sizes, overflow, type selection

## Code Organization
- **[Headers and Includes](headers-and-includes.md)** - How headers work, what to include where, and why
- **[File Organization](file-organization.md)** - Project structure and organization
- **[Makefiles](makefiles.md)** - Build system basics
- **[Constants and Scope](constants-and-scope.md)** - const, constexpr, and variable scope

## Debugging and Safety
- **[Common Pitfalls](common-pitfalls.md)** - Integer overflow, buffer overflow, dangling pointers
